# Sportdec coding challenge

## Introduction
Welcome to the coding challenge for developers interested in __backend__ roles in Sportdec. It's not an against-the-clock time challenge - you can complete it at home in your own time. 

Ideally you will return your submission in __within 7 days__ - the sooner you get your submission back to us, the more quickly we can progress your application to interview stage.

## The Challenge

1. Create a commandline API mashup of the Github and Twitter APIs

2. Search for "Football" projects on GitHub, then, for each project, search for any tweets mentioning it

3. Output the Github summary of each project together with a list of recent tweets

## Instructions

While you're free to choose the technologies you wish to use to complete this challenge, submissions in Node.js, Java, C#, or Go are preferable.

- We expect your submission to be 'production' quality - __we leave it to your own judgement what this might entail__

- Include any instructions required to run your submission in Markdown format

## Deadline

- While there is no specific deadline, we request that you return your submission within 7 days

- We're more interested in how well you approach and complete the challenge, rather than how quickly

## Guidelines

- You will require a Twitter consumer key and secret to complete this challenge 

- Do not include any private details with your submission. We suggest you make any private values such as API keys configurable

- As the Twitter API is rate limited retrieving tweets for a maximum of 10 projects will be sufficient

- Add your submission to Github as a private repo and add the following Sportdec team-members as collaborators:
