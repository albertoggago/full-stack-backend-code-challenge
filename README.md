# full-stack-backend-code-challenge

## Introduction
Welcome to the Sportdec coding challenge for engineers interested in roles on the __backend__ of the Sportdec mobile stack. The challenge is intended for candidates applying for mobile client development roles in our company. It's not a super-pressure time challenge - you can complete it at home, in your own time. Ideally you will complete this in less than __1 week__. 
The sooner you get your submission back to us, the sooner we can progess your application to final interviews.

    A little bit about us
    Sportdec is a sports companion app for sports fans. What's a sports companion app? 
    Well, we see it as providing fans with features and fun to compliment their 
    following of live games. That includes:
     * Realtime updates and notificaations on match scores and events :soccer:
     * Match, team and players stats
     * Orginal sport content of a fan's favourite teams
     * Pre- and live-match money betting
     * Sports games
     * And much more...


## The Challenge

1. Create a commandline API mashup of the Github and Twitter APIs.

2. Search for "Football" projects on GitHub, then, for each project, search for any tweets mentioning it.

3. Output the Github summary of each project together with a list of recent tweets.

## Instructions

We are not a dogmatic organisation - you are free to choose the technologies you wish to use to implement this challenge. However, given the nature of the role, the following are preferable to us:

- You may complete this challenge in Node.js (preferred), Java, or C#
- We expect your submission to be 'production' quality. We leave it to your judgement what this may entail
- Include any instructions required to run your submission in Markdown format

## Deadline

- While there is no specific deadline, we request that you complete and submit the challenge within 7 days

- We're more interested in how well you approach and complete the challenge, rather than how quickly

## Guidelines

- You will require a Twitter consumer key and secret to complete this challenge

- Do not include any private details with your submission. We suggest you make any private values such as API keys configurable

- As the Twitter API is rate limited retrieving tweets for a maximum of 10 projects will be sufficient

- Add your submission to Github as a private repo and add the following Sportdec team-members as collaborators:
  @onlydave;@dereklawless;@cusackd;@Wogiebear
